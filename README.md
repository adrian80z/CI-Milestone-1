## UX

The main goal of this project is to interest new members and keep existing ones. I want  to make that project as simple as possible so I decided to divide it to separate pages to keep it clear and not overhelming users with huge quantity of information right after entering homepage. Project consist of three main pages(Home, Classes, Contact) and 6 subpages which provide particular class details. I have included a lots of eye catching images which explaining more than text.

#### User Stories
- As user I want to know about upcoming events
- As a user I want to easy navigate throught website
- As a user I want to know what classes are available and some details about it
- As a user with no proir experience want to see some helpful videos about exercises
- As a user I want to know available contact ways
- I want to know timetables and gym location
- I want to get confirmation message after registration or message sent (future feature to implement)
- As a member I want to know about all benefits for members
- As a gym owner I want to attract new members and retain old ones as many as possible

- **[CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3)** - used to define styles for Web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
- **[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)** - used to program the behavior of Web pages
- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** - code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** - version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** - provides hosting for software development version control using Git.
- **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)** - library of free licensed fonts, an interactive web directory for browsing the library, and APIs for conveniently using the fonts via CSS ('_Lato_' font used in this project).
- **[Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)** - a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and LESS (icon used for mobile menu and social links in footer).

## Testing

For the testing was used following tools:
- **[Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)** - a set web authoring and debugging tools built into Google Chrome.
- **[CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)** -service helps to check validity of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
- **[Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)** - helps check the validity of Web documents.

All validation passed: no errors in the DevTools console, CSS and HTML have correct syntax as well.

The siteâ€™s navigation is consistent and reasoned. All links are working and pointing to correct place. Clicking the links in the footer will open them in a new tab.
All images resizing correctly also.

The site was tested across 3 browsers, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera. I used the Dev Tools in browsers to check for compatibility issues on mobile devices. 
Project also has been tested on Galaxy S3, Galaxy A20e and HTC One S.
The website looks consistent and fully responsive on all of them.

The website has two forms. One is on Home page. It is a registration form placed inside modal window and second one is on Contact page. Both forms have basic validation implemented using HTML5 features - _required_ property and for checking email address - _email_ property. After clicking submit without correcty filling the form error messages are displayed. As back-end functionality isn't implemented forms are not functional and does'nt display any confirmation message after sending data.
